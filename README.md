# Getting Started

This example project demonstrates different test setups in a Spring Boot Application. Please check
the javadoc comments on top of every Test class (in /src/test/java/).

You can access Swagger/Open-Api by going to [base-url]/swagger-ui/index.html

Please be aware, that Podman/Docker has to be setup to run all Tests successfully. For Installation/Setup on Windows, see: [https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md)
